Here are the short description about the target host from Task1.  
* OS: Windows7(32-bit)
* Immunity Debugger and Putty are preinstalled
* Windows Firewall and Defender are disabled  

With oscp.exe running on the target host, I executed a fuzzing python script, which crashed after sending 2000 bytes.  
```python3 fuzzer.py```
